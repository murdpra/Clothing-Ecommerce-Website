# Clothing Ecommerce Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Restoration Note

This project uses **React 17** and **React Router 5** to maintain compatibility with the original code written ~5 years ago.
Dependencies have been updated to support running on modern Node.js environments.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
